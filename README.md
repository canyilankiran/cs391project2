The program can be directly downloaded. Firstly, before the runnig application, user must download rode js for the react js. Then, user must start the fake json server with "json-server --watch hotelSimulation.json in the command prompt. Then, App.js is the starting page and it should be call others. We used IntellijIdea while coding the application, and it can be opened and run easily with it. We used some libraries such as Json-server, axios, react-boostrap, react-rooter-dom.

After pressing register button they need to enter their credentials correctly in login page in order to access to the application.

These 2 submit buttons have  functionality, this functionalities will send message to user about results of their decisions.  Also, there is a log out button at the header that provides log out functionality to the users.
